# Ai-Game-Maker
Automatically generates an AI Video game using Google's Gemini models and runs it. 

How it works:
This script contacts Gemini models and has it make a Python script that generates a random video game and runs it. It's pretty simple, really. 

In the future:
Working on a way for the AI to continue to generate levels for the game.
